# Wine-Dataset-Classification-with-KNN
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook detailed multi-class classification analysis of the Wine dataset using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The analysis demonstrates comprehensive data handling, pre-processing, and model evaluation techniques.

Key Highlights
Data Exploration: The Wine dataset, consisting of chemical analyses of wines from three different cultivars in the same region in Italy, was imported and analyzed. Initial exploration included dataset dimensions, descriptive statistics, and feature correlations.
Data Pre-processing: Standardization and dataset splitting were conducted to ensure optimal model training conditions.
Model Development & Evaluation: The KNN model showed excellent performance metrics:
Accuracy: 96%
Precision: 96%
Recall: 97%
F1 Score: 96%
Insights: The most strongly correlated features to the wine classes were identified as Flavanoids, Total Phenols, and OD280/OD315 of diluted wines.

Methodology
Detailed documentation of each analysis step, using markdown cells for clarity and comprehension.
Implementation of data visualization techniques to understand feature relationships and dataset characteristics.
Use of SKLearn for model development, training, and evaluation.

Conclusion
The notebook presents a thorough analysis and classification of the Wine dataset, achieving high performance with the KNN model. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the dataset's features and their impact on wine classification.
